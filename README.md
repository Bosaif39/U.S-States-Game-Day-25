# **U.S. States Game** 

## **Overview**  
This is the day 25 project of the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. A Python game that tests your knowledge of U.S. states. Using the **Turtle** and **Pandas** libraries, the game provides a graphical interface where you input state names, and correct guesses are marked on a U.S. map.  

## **How It Works**  
1. The game displays a blank map of the United States.  
2. You are prompted to type in the name of a U.S. state.  
3. If correct, the state name appears on the map at its corresponding location.  
4. The game continues until all 50 states are correctly guessed or the player types "Exit".  
5. When the player exits, a CSV file (`states_to_learn.csv`) is generated, listing the states that were not guessed.  

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module 
- `pandas` module 



## **Example**
